# Beginners-Python-Programs
<strong>I created this repo years ago when in school. From now it will be available as a public archive only.</strong><br/><br/>

Basic python CLI programs as examples.<br>
All the examples are useful examples.<br>
These examples are of beginner level.<br>

Note: In 2.x versions input isn't useful. Similarly, in 3.x versions raw_input isn't useful. Also, xrange() and other methods are discontinued or changed in 3.x versions of Python. Change the keywords accordingly.

<br>
Update: I wrote these programs when I was just starting out with programming, now I realize that many of them seem quite amateur in their rendering so I've decided to audit through all of them and update them according to my current capabilities.
